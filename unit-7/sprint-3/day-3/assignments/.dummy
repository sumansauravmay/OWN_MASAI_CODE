# Authentication App (FullStack)

## Instructions:

- Read the entire question carefully for at least 15 mins, understand it and then code it.
- Commit your code every 30min with a proper commit message to your repository (we will monitor every commit)
- Use **React** for Frontend.
- Use **Node,Express, Mongo (NEM)** for backend.

---

## Problem Statement:

The objective is to create a full stack authentication app with React as frontend, and NEM as backend.

## Backend:

Backend for the app should be created using NEM, using JSON server or localStorage to implement the functionality will be considered null and void.

### Functionalities:

- The user should be able to manually signup for a new account using “**register**” API.
- The user should be able to login manually using “l**ogin**” API.
- The user can log in or register with at least one of the following services **(OAuth)**:
    - Google
    - Facebook
    - Twitter
    - Github
- The user should be able to see profile details using “**getProfile**” API.
- The user should be able to edit his details including
    - Profile picture
    - Name
    - Bio
    - Phone
    - Email
    - Password
- Follow all the ideal coding standards, hash the password using any encrypting library such as “**bcrypt**” before storing in database, generate **“jsonwebtoken**” for successful login.

## Frontend:

- Use React for the frontend part of the app.
- Your app should have a navbar with the following routes
    - Signup
    - Signin
    - Profile Details
    - Edit Profile

### **Signup & Signin Route**

- The user should be able to register and login manually.
- User should be able to login using OAuth of any of the mentioned services.
- On login a “jsonwebtoken” should be generated from backend, and should be stored in localStorage.

### **Profile Details Route**

![                                                                           Reference Image - 2](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/d388edcd-0465-436a-a9fd-5a142d9ac1e5/Profile_Route.png)

                                                                           Reference Image - 2

- On visiting this route, all the details of the user should be fetched from the backend and displayed in the UI.
- The page should have logout button, which when clicked, the generated “jsonwebtoken” should  cancel and delete it from localStorage.
- There should be a edit profile button which when clicked the user should be redirected to the Edit Profile route.

### Edit **Profile Route**

![                                                          Reference Image - 3](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/5ba970b0-a6b8-4b34-82cb-068683fe1bda/Group_2.png)

                                                          Reference Image - 3

- On visiting this page, the user should be able to edit the details, and the changes should be reflected in the backend as well as UI.
