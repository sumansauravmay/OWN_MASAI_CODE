## `**Browse Classifieds`**

- Fetch all the classified posted from the backend server and list them in the form of cards.
- The UI should look like

![                                                                             UI Reference Image](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/2ac374a6-174c-4e1b-8239-96f84c155fd7/OLX-Classified-Reference-UI.png)

                                                                             UI Reference Image

- Your app should have the following functionalities and **should be implemented using backend.**
    - Filter by Category (Clothing, Electronics, Furniture, Other)
    - Sort by date (based on the posted date)
    - Search by product name
    - Pagination (4 Cards per page)
- Each card should have a “Buy” button, which when clicked that particular ad listing should be deleted from frontend as well as from backend.

---

## `**Submission`**

- Please submit deployed link and GitHub link of code.
- **Deploy backend as well**.
- **Push your code into `masai-repo`, don’t submit personal repo links.**
- Please double check if deployed version works or not (run deployed version on your laptop and then submit it).
- Any issues in deployed link, will be considered null and void.
