# `**Problem Statement**`

- The task is to build a library app, where the admin can ADD, UPDATE and DELETE books and the users can borrow the books.
- The app should have two sections,
    - Admin Section
    - User Section
- In the home screen make two buttons for these sections, on clicking on the buttons move to that particular section.
- Details of each section are given below.

# `**Admin Section**`

- Use reqres API to login as admin ([https://reqres.in/](https://reqres.in/)) -  LOGIN - SUCCESSFUL (refer to documentation)
- After successful login, the admin should be redirected to the admin dashboard.

## `**Admin Dashboard**`

- This page should have a form that takes the following information
    - Book Cover Image (Use placeholder or dummy images)
    - Name of the book
    - Author of the book
    - Genre -  select tag (Science, Fiction, History, Tech, Business)
    - Edition -  select tag (2020, 2021, 2022)
    - Publisher
    - Cost
- When admin submits the form, post data to JSON server (POST request)
- Sample data
    
    ```jsx
    [
      {
        "image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/5165He67NEL.jpg",
        "book_name": "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone",
        "author": "J. K. Rowling",
    		"genre": "fiction",
    		"edition": "2021",
    		"publisher": "Bloomsbury",
    		"cost": 1299,
    		"borrowed": false,
      }
    ]
    ```
    

- Use a JSON server to manage the data (using local storage or dummy data will lead to disqualification)
- Fetch this data from the JSON server and display it in table format below the form.
- The table should contain the following fields as columns
    - Book Cover Image (Use placeholder or dummy images)
    - Name of the book
    - Author of the book
    - Genre -  select tag (Science, Fiction, History, Tech, Business)
    - Edition -  select tag (2020, 2021, 2022)
    - Publisher
    - Cost
    - Edit
    - Delete
- When admin clicks on edit, admin should be able to edit/change details of the book in JSON data (you can use a modal for this) and display updated data in the table.
- When clicking on Delete, delete that particular entry from JSON data.

---

# `**User Section**`

- Fetch all the data of books from the JSON server and display them in form of cards.

        - History
        - Tech

- When clicking on the Borrow button, open up a modal that shows the summary of the bill along with book details.
